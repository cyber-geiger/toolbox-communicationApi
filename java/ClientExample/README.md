# Geiger API Java Client Example

This project serves as an example of how to use the Java [`GeigerApiPluginConnector`](/java/GeigerApiPluginConnector/). It requires the example Dart master app under [`dart/geiger_api/example/master_app`](/dart/geiger_api/example/master_app/) to also be installed.

## Functionality

Right now the app only registers itself on the master and has no interactivity.
