# iOS

## Prerequisites

    - An Apple Mac device with Flutter installed 
    - Android Studio with the Flutter extension and or XCode
    - A Domain / Subdomain name 
    - An Apple Developer Account

## Create a new Flutter iOS project

### using Android Studio

1. Click on New Flutter Project
2. On the project creation wizard, make sure iOS is ticked as a Platform
3. Follow the rest of the creation dialog

### using the Console

```
flutter create --org com.example your_app_name
```

## Add iOS support to an existing Android project

run 
```
    flutter create --platforms=android,ios .
```

in the project root and it will add the required files for all platforms

## Replace the AppDelegate with the following one


```swift

import UIKit
import Flutter
import Foundation
import AVFoundation

@UIApplicationMain
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    
    var controller: FlutterViewController?;
    var messageChannel: FlutterMethodChannel?;
    var dispatchQueue: DispatchQueue = DispatchQueue.global();
    
    func openUrl(toOpen: String?){
        if let url = URL(string: toOpen!) {
            if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
                UIApplication.shared.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)
            } else {
                UIApplication.shared.openURL(url);
            }
        }
    }

    
    // when the app gets restored from background
    override func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                         continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,
                         restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]) -> Void) -> Bool
    {
        // Get URL components from the incoming user activity.
        guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
            let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL,
            let components = NSURLComponents(url: incomingURL, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true) else {
            return false
        }

        // Check for specific URL components.
        if components.path != nil {
            if let params = components.queryItems {
                if let data = params.first(where: { $0.name == "redirect" })?.value {
                    openUrl(toOpen: String(data));
                    return true
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    
    //when the app was fully closed
    override func application(_ application: UIApplication, 
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        controller = window?.rootViewController as? FlutterViewController
        messageChannel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "cyber-geiger.eu/communication", binaryMessenger: controller!.binaryMessenger)

        messageChannel!.setMethodCallHandler({
            (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: @escaping FlutterResult) -> Void in
            if (call.method == "url") {
                let args = call.arguments as! Optional<String>
                self.openUrl(toOpen: args);
                result(nil);
            }
        });
      
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }
}


```
## Create an App ID in the Apple Developer Portal

On the Apple Developer website, navigte to [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) and click on Add (+)
 - Select App IDs
 - Select App
 - Add a Description and fill out Bundel Identifier with your Bundle identifier
 - Select the Capability `Associated Domains` and any other Capabilites you need.
 - Click Register
 - Click on the created AppID and copy the app id prefix


## Create an apple associated Domain


Note: Make sure the domain uses SSL / https

Create a file named `apple-app-site-association` in the root of your website and add the following to it:
```
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
    {
      "appID": "APP_ID.BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER",
      "paths": ["*"]
    }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `APP_ID` with the app id prefix from the previously created App ID
Replace `BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` with the bundle identifier used in the previously created App ID

You must host the file using https:// with a valid certificate and with no redirects.

Make sure that if you visit https://yourdomain.com/apple-app-site-association that your file is served. (replace yourdomain with the domain used)


## Add the capability and associated domains entitlement to your app

Open the iOS workspace in XCode

Click on the Runner Target (dark blue icon) on the left

Open the targetâ€™s Signing & Capabilities tab

Click on Add (+) at the top left next to the profiles

Add the Associated Domains capability

Under Associated Domain click Add (+) at the bottom of the Domains table and replace the placeholder with the following

`applinks:yourdomain.com` where you would replace yourdomain.com with your domain that is a valid apple associated domain.

an example would be: `applinks:client.cyber-geiger.eu`


## Add the Dart package

In the pubspec.yml add `geiger_api` as a dependency


## Dart Geiger API Usage

Make sure you add your apple associated domain as a 4th value onto the executor
and chose a unique plugin id
```
const pluginExecutor = 'com.example.client_app;'
    'com.example.client_app.MainActivity;'
    'TODO;'
    'https://client.cyber-geiger.eu';

const pluginId = 'my-plugin';
```

and then get the geiger api:

```
await getGeigerApi(pluginExecutor, pluginId)
```

In your dartcode you can now use the geiger api as you always would
