## 0.5.3 
Added support for autodetection of the storage location. Warning: This breaks dart compatibility due 
to the requirement of path_provider. From here we have 'Flutter only'. Anyone knowing a sensible 
alternative is warmly welcomed.  

## 0.5.2
Added PluginListener to the list of exported APIs.

## 0.5.1
Added support for always traceable replies in the Message class. Required for replication and waiting for related, subsequent messages.

## 0.5.0

- Initial version (covers only local plugin communication)
